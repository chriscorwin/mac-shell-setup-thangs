# This file has not yet been activated, getting ready for Zsh

# Installed zsh-completions from brew, it had this advice:

## To activate these completions, add the following to your .zshrc:
## 
##   fpath=(/usr/local/share/zsh-completions $fpath)
## 
## You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:
## 
##   rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit
## 
## Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
## to load these completions, you may need to run this:
## 
##   chmod go-w '/usr/local/share'
